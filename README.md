(1) Each time I update the contents, I will upload the relevant codes and reports/ notes at the "Update_Folder". There will also be a small descriptive note to explan how to read or use the updated contents.

(2) Also, I will write a total timeline recordings notes at the "Timeline_Recording" folder to record each update's contents with dates. The recorded timepoints are based on the plan above.

(3) Finally, when all work has been done. I will write the final report with references at the "Final_Report_with_References" folder. These will summary all my 3-month work.
